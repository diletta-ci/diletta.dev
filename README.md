# diletta.dev personal website
This is my personal website and blog.

You can visit it on [diletta.dev](https://diletta.dev).

I write about Software Engineering Managers' best practices and personal experiences.

## Objective
I made this website with the objective of writing, to help myself remember my learnings and help others in the same process and career path.

## Tech stack
This website uses the framework [HUGO](https://gohugo.io).
I choose it because is light and easy to build up.

Also, I wanted a Jamstack, and something easy to build on [Netlify](http://netlify.com), where I host this site.

## How to... 
### Run the project in local
After installing HUGO, on the base folder launch the command
```shell
hugo server
```

### Create a new post
To write a new post, launch
```shell
hugo new post/my-new-post-title.md
```
